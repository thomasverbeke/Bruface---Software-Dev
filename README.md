Bruface---Software-Dev
======================

Bruface Software Dev Project

For the course of Software for Embedded Systems by Prof. D'Hondt at Bruface (ULB/VUB) I choose a project that I worked on last year called TTREX.
That project was centered arround developing a tracking system for the 24h run organised each year by LOKO in leuven. 

The goal of the Bruface project was to improve on the code by means of automated unit testing.

The deliverables include
-Project description & strategy
-Effort estimation planning
-Final Report

As to seperate the orginal source code with the new code I have added repositories for the old code:
